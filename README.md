#### Mars_Scraping

## Description
In this challenge, I was asked to analyze and explore HTML elements on a webpage and scrape information about news related to Mars using Beautiful Soup. For the second portion, I extracted Martian weather data from a website and was able to perform calculations and create graphs to represent the data. This allowed me to draw conclusions about the temperature, atmospheric pressure, and day count on Mars and compare it to Earth's.

To accomplish this analysis, I utilized my Mac OS, Beautiful Soup, Splinter, Pandas, Matplotlib, and GitHub.

## Table of Contents
Code for analysis found in the 'part_1_mars_news.ipynb' and 'part_2_mars_weather.ipynb' files within the 'Data_scraping' directory. Data for analysis was compiled into the 'mars_data.csv' located in the 'Data_scraping' directory.

## Installation Instructions
Code utilized for this challenge can be found in the files within the 'Data_scraping' directory on my github "Mars_scraping" repo.

## Usage
Can Git Clone all files from my 'mars_scraping' repo.

## Credits
For this challenge I utilized the ASK BCS feature on Slack, Google, ChatGPT, fellow students, YouTube, Stack Overflow, TA assistance, Bootcamp tutor assistance, and educational resources related to the unit provided by the bootcamp.
